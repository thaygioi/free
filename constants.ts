  repair: 'Your task is strictly technical repair of physical damage (scratches, dust, tears, creases). The person\'s face, including every line, shadow, and proportion, is an unchangeable reference. DO NOT alter, smooth, or \'improve\' any facial features. The goal is to make it look like a clean scan of the original, undamaged photograph. Do not colorize it.',
  enhance: 'Increase the resolution and sharpness of this image. Your task is to clarify *existing* details, not invent new ones. For male subjects, apply a refined yet realistic skin smoothing effect. This should reduce noise and minor blemishes to create a clearer appearance, but you must preserve the natural skin texture to ensure the result is authentic and not artificial. For female subjects, ensure skin smoothing is delicate, preserving natural beauty without creating an artificial or \'airbrushed\' look. Hair should be detailed and realistic. Enhance textures in hair and clothing that are already visible. ABSOLUTE RULE: The facial identity, structure, and expression must be 100% identical to the source. Do not change the shape of the eyes, nose, or mouth. The output must be the same person, just clearer.',
  colorize: 'Apply realistic, historically appropriate color to this B&W photo. Treat the original image as a locked, unchangeable base layer. Your only task is to add a color layer on top. For clothing, deduce the fabric and style to apply vibrant, rich, and realistic colors that are appropriate for the era. The colors should be beautiful and bring the clothing to life, while remaining believable. Avoid muted or washed-out tones unless the original fabric was intentionally so. CRITICAL RULE FOR MALE SUBJECTS: DO NOT make the lips red or pink. The lip color must be natural and subtle. For female subjects, apply natural and appropriate lip and cheek tones; avoid overly saturated or modern-looking makeup unless it\'s consistent with the photo\'s era. DO NOT modify the underlying grayscale information, especially facial features, shadows, and textures. The identity of the person must be perfectly preserved.',
  comprehensive_male: 'NON-NEGOTIABLE DIRECTIVE: YOU MUST PRESERVE THE IDENTITY OF THE MAN IN THE PHOTO. DO NOT CREATE A NEW PERSON. The original photo is the absolute ground truth for the face. Your sequential tasks are: 1. **Repair:** Fix physical damage (scratches, dust, tears). 2. **Enhance & Clean:** Sharpen existing details. Carefully remove non-permanent skin blemishes (like spots or temporary marks) while preserving permanent features (moles, scars). Apply a *refined yet realistic* skin smoothing. The goal is to reduce minor imperfections and noise to create a clearer, more pleasant appearance, while *critically preserving* the natural male skin texture and character. The result must look naturally smooth and authentic, not artificial or airbrushed. 3. **Colorize:** Apply realistic, historically appropriate color. **SPECIFIC COLOR RULES:** For clothing, deduce the fabric and style to apply vibrant, rich, and realistic colors that are appropriate for the era. The colors should be beautiful and bring the clothing to life, while remaining believable. Avoid muted or washed-out tones unless the original fabric was intentionally so. IT IS FORBIDDEN to make the lips red or pink. Lip color must be neutral and natural. **PROHIBITED ACTIONS:** Do not "beautify" or idealize the face. Do not change the shape of the eyes, nose, mouth, or jawline. The result must be a high-resolution, colored version of the EXACT SAME man in the original photo, looking authentic and respectful.',
